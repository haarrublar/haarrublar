### Welcome all! ðŸ‘ŠðŸ‘‹

I'm Harrinson Arrubla mathematician graduated from the Universidad Nacional de Colombia surrounded by montains in the heart of the coffee area in Colombia. Right now, I'm finishing my Master degree in [Applied Statistics & Data Science](https://www.utrgv.edu/graduate/for-future-students/graduate-programs/program-requirements/applied-statistics-and-data-science-ms/index.htm) at The University of Texas Rio Grande Valley. I'm interested in researching about statistical learning methods using graph and bayesian theory. I'd like to explore NLP and geometry applications over data science.

I've been working on stable distributions for solving fractional partial and ordinary differential equations modeled by markov chain monte carlo, monte carlo integration and importance sampling directed. This thesis is directed by phD. [Tamer Oraby](https://faculty.utrgv.edu/tamer.oraby/index.htm) (advisor), and phD. [Erwin Suazo](https://faculty.utrgv.edu/erwin.suazo/) (co-advisor).
